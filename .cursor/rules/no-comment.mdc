Do not add comments to the code when generating or modifying files.

This includes:
- Inline comments explaining code logic
- Function/method documentation comments
- JSDoc or TSDoc comments
- TODO or FIXME comments
- Multi-line explanatory comments
- Block comments describing what code does

Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names instead.

Only add comments if absolutely necessary for:
- Legal requirements (copyright notices, licenses)
- Complex algorithms where clarity is critical and cannot be expressed through code structure
- External API or library behavior that is non-obvious and critical

Examples of what to avoid:

Bad:
```typescript
// Get the user from the database
const user = await db.getUser(id);
```

Good:
```typescript
const user = await db.getUser(id);
```
